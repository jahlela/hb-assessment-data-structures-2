Recursion

    1. Recursion is the process of a function calling itself.

    2. Without a base case (a halting condition), a function will run
       forever or until the machine running it runs out of memory, which
       will result in a "RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded" 
       message and a terminated program.
 

Graphs

    1. Graphs are one or more connected or unconnected nodes which can be
       cyclic or acyclic, and directed or undirected. 

    2. Trees, unlike graphs, cannot have directed edges, nor can they have 
       loops.

    3. One could graph all of the tributaries that lead to a  major river.
